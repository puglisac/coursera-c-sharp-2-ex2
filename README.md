# Exercise 1: Arrays

This is an exercise for the coursera course [More C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/more-programming-unity)

### Getting Started

Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the ConsoleCards link in the pane on the left; this is the documentation for the classes I provided to you in the ConsoleCards dll.

Open the Exercise1 solution in your IDE.

### Problem 1 - Create objects

Because you'll be using the classes in the **ConsoleCards** namespace from the dll I added to the project, add a using directive for that namespace at the top of the Program.cs file.

Inside the **Main** method, declare a deck variable and create a new **Deck** object for that variable.

Inside the **Main method, declare an array variable **that will hold 5 cards and create a new array object for that variable.

Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

### Problem 2 - Add card to the array, flip it over, and print it

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 0 in the array.

Flip the card at element 0 of the array over.

Tell the card at element 0 of the array to print itself.

### Problem 3 - Add another card to the array, flip it over, and print both cards

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 1 in the array.

Flip the card at element 1 of the array over.

Tell the cards at elements 0 and 1 of the array to print themselves.
